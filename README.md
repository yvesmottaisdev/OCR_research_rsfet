Research for an OCR Receipt Scanner for Expenses Tracker.

### What's an OCR?
Optical character recognition is a fundamental technology for text conversion, from hand-written or print text to machine-encoded text.

### Brief
A character recognition system is needed for an expenses tracker, where it'll be used to manage supermarket purchases by scanning receipts on search of Products to analyze. The extracted text must be converted into JSON in order to digest the information through the app.

### OCR Techniques
- Pre-processing (De-skewing, Despekling, Binarization, Line-removal, Layout analysis or zoning, Line and word detection, Script recognition, Character isolation or segmentation, Normalization of aspect ratio and scale)
- Text recognition (Feature extraction, Matrix matching)
- Post-processing
